This program allows the user to view a randomly generated maze

The user may view the maze either as ASCII characters, or as an image

Maze components are represented by the following ASCII characters:
	Wall:	'#'
	Space:	' '
	Door:	'E'
	
Images of each component were drawn in GIMP 2.6 and are stored in the Java project folder as .png files

The program implements a flyweight and facade pattern

The flyweight is implemented by 5 classes:
	MazeTile - Abstract class containing char, BufferedImage and int, 
		representing ASCII representation, image representation and key, respectively,
		along with getter methods for these variables
	MazeWall, MazeSpace and MazeDoor - Concrete implementations of MazeTile class containing constructor
		which sets values of ASCII representation, image representation and key of parent class
	MazeFactory - Contains array of each MazeTile implementation and getter method for each object based on key
	
The facade is implemented by a single class:
	MazeFacade - Provides an interface to methods of the FlyWeight classes
