This program implements an arithmetic expression parser and evaluator

This program is build on a hybrid composite/decorator architecture

The composite architecture is implemented by the ArithmeticNumberDecorator and ArithmeticOperatorDecorator classes extending the ArithmeticNode class

The decorator architecture is implemented by the QuotedArithmeticOperator, QuotedArithmeticNumber, UnquotedArithmeticOperator and UnquotedArithmeticNumber classes implementing their respective decorator classes
